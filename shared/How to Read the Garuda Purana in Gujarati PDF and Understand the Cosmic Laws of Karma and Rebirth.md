The Uttara Khanda contains 45 chapters that narrate various stories and legends related to Lord Vishnu, Garuda, and other deities and sages.
 
The Garud Puran is considered to be a sacred text by many Hindus who believe that reading or listening to it can bring peace and solace to the departed souls and their relatives.

## The Journey of the Soul After Death
 
One of the most fascinating and important topics covered by the Garud Puran is the journey of the soul after death. According to the Garud Puran, the soul leaves the body at the time of death and is accompanied by a subtle body that consists of the mind, intellect, ego, and senses. The subtle body carries the impressions and memories of the previous life, as well as the karmic debts and merits that determine the fate of the soul in the next life.
 
The Garud Puran describes in detail the various stages and experiences that the soul undergoes after death. The first stage is called Yamaloka, where the soul is brought before Yama, the god of death and justice. Yama reviews the deeds and actions of the soul in its previous life and assigns it to either heaven or hell, depending on its karma. The second stage is called Naraka or hell, where the soul suffers various punishments and torments for its sins and misdeeds. The third stage is called Svarga or heaven, where the soul enjoys various pleasures and rewards for its virtues and good deeds. The fourth stage is called Pitraloka or the world of ancestors, where the soul meets its relatives and friends who have passed away before. The fifth stage is called Pretaloka or the world of ghosts, where the soul wanders aimlessly and miserably due to its unfulfilled desires and attachments. The sixth stage is called Bhuloka or the world of humans, where the soul takes birth again in a new body according to its karma.
 
The Garud Puran also explains how the relatives and friends of the deceased can help the soul in its journey by performing various rituals and rites, such as offering water, food, clothes, and charity to the needy; chanting mantras and prayers; observing fasts and vows; performing shraddha or ancestral worship; donating cows, land, gold, etc.; and conducting ceremonies such as pindadan or offering rice balls to the departed.
 
## The Laws of Karma and Rebirth
 
Another major theme of the Garud Puran is the laws of karma and rebirth. Karma means action or deed, and it refers to both physical and mental activities that have consequences for oneself and others. Karma can be classified into three types: sanchita karma or accumulated karma from past lives; prarabdha karma or destined karma that determines one's present life; and agami karma or future karma that results from one's present actions.

The Garud Puran teaches that every action has a reaction, and every cause has an effect. Whatever one does in this life will have an impact on one's future lives. One's thoughts, words, and deeds create positive or negative impressions on one's mind and subtle body that influence one's destiny. One's karma also determines one's birth in a particular family, caste, class, gender, race, etc., as well as one's physical appearance, health, wealth, intelligence, talents, etc.
 
The Garud Puran also teaches that one can change one's karma by performing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds. One can also purify one's mind and subtle body by practicing meditation, devotion, service, charity, etc. One can also seek forgiveness from those whom one has harmed or offended by apologizing sincerely and making amends. One can also invoke the grace of God and Guru by praying sincerely and surrendering oneself to them.
 
The Garud Puran states that the ultimate goal of human life is to attain moksha or liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Moksha means freedom from ignorance, attachment, desire, ego, suffering, etc., and realization of one's true nature as pure consciousness or Brahman. Moksha can be attained by following any of the four paths: jnana or knowledge; bhakti or devotion; karma or action; or yoga or union.
